## Running Locally

2. cd into the project root and run `npm install`
3. run `npm start`

## Specification
You can start by downloading [local backend development server](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter). The server is built in Node, but it is very simple. You won't need to edit the server code; instead, your code will talk to the server using documented API endpoints.

You can use the server's endpoints to manage storing, reading, updating, and deleting data for your application.
